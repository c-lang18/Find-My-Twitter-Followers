# Find-My-Twitter-Followers
Quick and dirty script to find your followers / people you followed on your twitter account. Great if you started a new account but want to follow the same people without having to manually look them up or try and remember them all (hint: you won't)


### How to use:
- If you're deactivating your twitter account, before doing so go to https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data and click 'Download Data'. This script works on active accounts too, if you needed a text version of all your followers for some reason. 
- Extract the zip file that twitter gives you, then copy this script into the extracted folder. 
*Your twitter follower / following file (choose which) must be placed in the same directory as this script or it won't run!*
- You can deactivate your account now, since you've just pulled the data from it (which has your saved followers, those who followed you, etc)

### WARNING!

- This script generates a file with links to all your followed accounts, and it opens each link as a tab in your browser. Make sure to disable this first if you only want the text file!

- This script opens up all the links to every account you follow at once - I only had ~150 people I followed, but if you have hundreds or thousands this will probably crash your browser and make your PC hang. Use at your own peril! Or modifiy it yourself for a high volume of followers/followed accounts.
